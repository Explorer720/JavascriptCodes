<!-- Learning JS Events -->
<!-- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. -->


<!-- An HTML web page has finished loading.An HTML input field was changed.An HTML button was clicked.Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements. -->
